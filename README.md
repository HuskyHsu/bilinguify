## How to set environment

The usage of installing third-party packages using `poetry` or `pip` are as follows:

### poetry

Create the virtualenv inside the projectâ€™s root directory. (suggestion)

```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry config virtualenvs.create true
```

[virtualenvs.in-project](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvsin-project)

The shell command spawns a shell, according to the $SHELL environment variable, within the virtual environment. If one doesnâ€™t exist yet, it will be created.

```shell
poetry shell
```

The install command reads the pyproject.toml file from the current project, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.

```shell
poetry install
```

### pip

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Work flow

### main flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Read EPUB file]-->B(Extract text);
    B-->C(Translate);
    C-->D(Output translated text);
    D-->E[Create new EPUB file];
```

### translate flow

```mermaid
graph TB
A(start)-->B(create api key/data/result queue)
B-->D(get api key and item data for queue)
D-->E(translate)
E-->G(result add to result queue)
G-->H(api key add to queue)
H-->I{data queue is emtry?}
I--no-->D
I--yes-->J(cancel task)
J-->K(end)
```
